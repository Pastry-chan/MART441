For this assignment the GenAI seemed to know a lot more than me (of course) so it was trying to do things that I didn't understand, at least not yet. Such as actualImages = actualImagePath.concat(actualImagePath); I don't know what concat is yet but good for you buddy.
It also was doing things in a different way such as shuffling the cards and trying to add more complex things such as flipping the cards back over and what not. Overall I felt kind of stupid.
