For me the hardest part about this assignment was actually thinking about what story I wanted to do that would be fun but easy.
From there it was very difficult to figure out how to create different branching story lines, I don't know if that's the right word but I assume you understand what I mean. Once I figured out the endings I wanted it became easier to figure out how to get the player there. If I had a lot more time I would have drawn out the different scenes and I would love to make it so that the images changes with each scene rather than just being one image.
