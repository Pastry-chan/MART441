## What I created vs someone else

I managed to find someone else's website using HTML and Javascript. They were far more advanced than mine and I couldn't really explain half the code they used.
However I prefer mine to theirs because I took time to learn new things and re-learn things from previous classes. While I did have to take a moment to look up tutorials
on how to do certain things, it felt more rewarding doing it myself rather than solely relying on GenAI or someone else. The final works feels a lot like my own since I planned
out the simple layout, chose my favorite color to be the background and took the time and effort to figure out the code.
